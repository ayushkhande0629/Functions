        "# Functions\n",
        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?  \n",
        "  - A **function** in Python is an independent block of code designed to perform a specific task and is usually defined using the def keyword outside of classes. A **method** is a function that is associated with an object and defined inside a class, always taking self as its first parameter. Functions can be called without the need for any object, while methods require an instance of the class to be called. Methods can access and modify the object's state, whereas functions operate on their own local scope.\n",
        "---\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.  \n",
        "- **Parameters** are variables listed in a function’s definition, acting as placeholders for values. **Arguments** are the actual values supplied to the function when it is called. Parameters allow functions to accept dynamic input and make them reusable for different values. Python supports various types of parameters such as positional, keyword, default, and variable-length, which offer a flexible way of passing data to functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?  \n",
        "- Python functions can be defined using the def keyword for standard functions or the lambda keyword for anonymous functions. Functions are called by writing their name followed by parentheses and passed arguments if required, while methods are called on object instances using dot notation. Additionally, functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables, demonstrating first-class citizen behavior.\n",
        "---\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function?  \n",
        "- The **return** statement ends the function’s execution and sends an optional value back to the caller. If return is omitted or used without a value, the function returns None by default. It allows functions to output results that can be stored or used in other expressions. The return statement can also terminate the function early, which is useful for conditional exits within the function logic.\n",
        "---\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?  \n",
        "- An **iterator** is an object with \\_\\_iter\\_\\_() and \\_\\_next\\_\\_() methods that allows sequential access to elements, returning items one at a time until items are exhausted, after which it raises StopIteration. An **iterable** is any object that can provide an iterator, such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Every iterator is also an iterable, but not every iterable is an iterator; iterators “remember” their position, while fresh iterators can be created from iterables.\n",
        "---\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.  \n",
        "- **Generators** are special functions that use the yield statement instead of return, producing a sequence of values one at a time and resuming execution where they left off on subsequent calls. They are defined like normal functions but use yield to return data, making them memory-efficient for large datasets. Unlike regular functions, generators don’t compute all their values at once, enabling the handling of infinite or very large sequences.\n",
        "---\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?  \n",
        "Generators generate values on the fly, conserving memory as they don’t store the entire sequence in memory, making them ideal for large or infinite datasets. They also enhance performance by producing elements only when needed and simplifying code that deals with complex iteration logic. By using the yield keyword, generators support stateful iteration without the boilerplate of implementing iterator classes.\n",
        "---\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?  \n",
        "- A **lambda function** is an anonymous, one-line function defined with the lambda keyword, useful for simple operations that don’t require naming. They are commonly used when a small function is needed for a short period, such as in sorting, mapping, or filtering collections. Lambda functions help keep code concise and readable, especially when passed as arguments to higher-order functions like map or filter.\n",
        "---\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.  \n",
        "- The **map()** function applies a specified function to every item of an iterable, such as a list or tuple, and returns a map object (an iterator) with the results. It is useful for transforming or processing items without the need for an explicit loop. map() can be combined with lambda functions for succinct transformations, allowing for functional programming patterns in Python.\n",
        "---\n",
        "10. What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python?  \n",
        "- **map()** applies a function to all elements in an iterable and returns an iterator of results. **filter()** keeps only those items in an iterable for which a function returns True, discarding the rest. **reduce()** (from functools) successively applies a function to pairs of items in an iterable, combining them into a single cumulative value, often used for aggregation or summarization tasks.\n",
        "---\n",
        "11. Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using  reduce function on this given list:[47,11,42,13].\n",
